## Introduction

Welcome to [Vectordash](https://vectordash.com/)! Here you'll find comprehensive information for basic command line interactions with Vectordash machines. We do our best to make this documentation clear and user friendly, but if you have unanswered questions, please visit the community forum or contact us at [contact@vectordash.com](mailto:contact@vectordash.com).

The fastest way to familiarize yourself with the Vectordash Client command line is to rent out a GPU and take it for a spin. You can connect to a Vectordash machine, transfer files, and kick-off a job using the Vectordash CLI. 

For our hosts, the Vectordash Host command line package is to make your life easier. You can retrieve the necessary files, and simply run vdhost commands to get your machine set up to host on Vectordash!
