## Checks if the client is running on this machine

### Usage
```bash
vdhost is-running
```

### Description 
Use this command to check if you have already started the client daemon process on this machine.  

If you have not downloaded and stored the vectordash-host package files in the appropriate location (via the `vdhost install` command), it will say that the process is not currently running on this machine.

### Example
```bash
$ vdhost is-running
The Vectordash hosting client is currently running on this machine
```
